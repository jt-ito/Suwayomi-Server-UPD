/**
 * Some sources release the same chapter multiple times under different scanlators/release
 * groups (e.g. chapter 5 by "Alpha", "Beta", and "Gamma"). Naively counting chapter rows
 * inflates unread/total/download counts for these manga. These helpers group chapters by
 * their real-world identity — [chapterNumber] when it's known ([ChapterTable.chapter_number]
 * defaults to -1f when a source doesn't provide one), otherwise the trimmed, lowercased
 * [name] — so each logical chapter is only counted once regardless of how many scanlator
 * copies exist for it.
